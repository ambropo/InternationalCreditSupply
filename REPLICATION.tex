\noindent This repository includes the codes to replicate the baseline VAR and the theoretical model in A. Cesa-Bianchi, A. Ferrero, and A. Rebucci (2018) "International Credit Supply Shocks," published in the the \textit{Journal of International Economics}. 

\section*{VAR}
To replicate the VAR results run \texttt{VAR$\backslash$GO\_CFR\_PVAR.m}. The code runs the two routines:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{GO0\_Data.m}: reads from \texttt{CodeVar.xls} and \texttt{DataQ\_57C.xls} to create the data used for the estimation. 
	\item \texttt{GO1\_VAR.m}: estimates the country VARs, computes the impulse response functions, and exports charts and tables, stored in the folder \texttt{../OUT}.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Theoretical Model}
To replicate the results from the theoretical model run \texttt{Model$\backslash$GO\_CFR\_Model.m}.
